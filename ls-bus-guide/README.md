# FMI LS BUS Implementers' Guide

[![Build Specification](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-guides/actions/workflows/build-guides.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-guides/actions/workflows/build-guides.yml)

This directory contains the current prototype draft Implementers'
Guide for the upcoming [FMI-LS-BUS][FMI-LS-BUS] layered standard for
the exchange of simulation models employing bus communication.  Note
that this draft is being worked on actively, and thus subject to change
without notice.

It is not normative, nor is it to be considered officially endorsed
by the Modelica Association prior to official adoption.

The [guide][] is currently maintained on [GitHub][github] and is
published [here][guide]. It is based on the [FMI-LS-BUS][] layered
standard.
