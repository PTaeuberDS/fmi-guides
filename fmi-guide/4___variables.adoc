== Parameter and Variable Handling

=== Support for Physical Units

Importing implementations should support the processing of physical unit information when present on the variables of an imported FMU, including support for unit consistency checks and optional automatic unit conversions, especially when FMI 2.0/3.0 SI-based unit information is available.

The unit information should be overridable by the user to account for exceptional circumstances:
For example, when erroneous unit information on a variable has to be manually adjusted since changes to the FMU are not otherwise practicable.

Exporting implementations should generate physical unit information on all exported variables when such information is available in the model (or can be automatically derived).

On FMI 2.0 and later versions, the support for SI-based units, using the `BaseUnit` element should be used.
This enables a number of important use cases:

Unit check when connecting variables of different FMUs::
+
When only one of an input variable `v2` and an output variable `v1`, connected with equation `v2 = v1`, defines a `BaseUnit` element, or neither does, the connection equation `v2 = v1` holds.
+
When two variables `v1` and `v2` (of the same or different FMUs) are connected and for both of them `BaseUnit` elements are defined, then they must have identical exponents of their `BaseUnit`.
If both `factor` and `offset` attributes are also identical, the connection equation `v2 = v1` again holds.
If `factor` and `offset` are not identical, the tool may either trigger an error or, if supported, perform a conversion; in other words, use the connection equation (in this case the `relativeQuantity` of the `TypeDefinition`, see below, has to be taken into account in order to determine whether `offset` shall or shall not be utilized):
+
`factor(v1) * v1 + (if relativeQuantity(v1) then 0 else offset(v1)) = factor(v2) * v2 + (if relativeQuantity(v2) then 0 else offset(v2))` +
where `relativeQuantity(v1) = relativeQuantity(v2)` is required.
+
As a result, wrong connections can be detected (for example, connecting a force with an angle-based variable would trigger an error) and conversions between, say, US and SI units can be either automatically performed or, if not supported, an error is triggered as well.
+
This approach is not satisfactory for variables belonging to different quantities that have, however, the same `BaseUnit`, such as quantities `Energy` and `Torque`, or `AngularVelocity` and `Frequency`.
To handle such cases, quantity definitions have to be taken into account (see `TypeDefinitions`) and quantity names need to be standardized.
+
This approach allows a general treatment of units, without being forced to standardize the grammar and allowed values for units (for example, in FMI 1.0, a unit could be defined as `N.m` in one FMU and as `N*m` in another FMU, and a tool would have to reject a connection, since the units are not identical.
In FMI 2.0 and later, the connection would be accepted, provided both elements have the same `BaseUnit` definition).

Dimensional analysis of equations::
+
In order to check the validity of equations in a modeling language, the defined units can be used for dimensional analysis, by using the `BaseUnit` definition of the respective unit.
For this purpose, the `BaseUnit` `rad` has to be treated as `1`.
Example:
+
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{align*}
J \cdot \alpha = \tau \rightarrow [kg.m^2]*[rad/s^2] = [kg.m^2/s^2] & \quad \text{// o.k. ("rad" is treated as "1")} \\
J \cdot \alpha = f \rightarrow [kg.m^2]*[rad/s^2] = [kg.m/s^2] & \quad \text{// error, since dimensions do not agree}
\end{align*}
++++

Unit propagation::
+
If unit definitions are missing for variables, they might be deduced from the equations where the variables are used.
If no unit computation is needed, `rad` is propagated.
If a unit computation is needed and one of the involved units has `rad` as a `BaseUnit`, then unit propagation is not possible.
Examples:
+
- a = b + c, and `Unit` of c is provided, but not `Unit` of a and b: +
The Unit definition of `c` (in other words, `Unit.name`, `BaseUnit`, `DisplayUnit`) is also used for `a` and `b`.
For example, if BaseUnit(c) = `rad/s`, then BaseUnit(a) = BaseUnit(b) = `rad/s`.
+
- a = b*c, and `Unit` of a and of c is provided, but not `Unit` of b: +
If `rad` is either part of the `BaseUnit` of `a` and/or of `c`, then the `BaseUnit` of `b` cannot be deduced (otherwise it can be deduced).
Example: If `BaseUnit(a) = kg.m/s2` and `BaseUnit(c) = m/s2`, then the `BaseUnit(b) can be deduced to be `kg`.
In such a case `Unit.name` of b cannot be deduced from the `Unit.name` of `a` and `c`, and a tool would typically construct the `Unit.name` of `b` from the deduced `BaseUnit`.

=== Support for Min/Max Range Information

Importing implementations should support the processing of min/max limit information when present on the variables of an imported FMU.
This support should include support for limit consistency checks and optional runtime checking.

The limit information should be overridable by the user to account for exceptional circumstances:
For example, when erroneous limits on a variable have to be manually adjusted since changes to the FMU are not otherwise practicable.

Exporting implementations should generate min/max limit information on all exported variables that support this information in FMI when such limit information is available in the model (or can be automatically derived).
Ideally, it should be possible to generate FMUs that optionally check the limits (especially user-supplied limits) at runtime and produce suitable errors and diagnostic logging information when limits are breached.

Implementations are well-advised to heed the explanations in section 2.2.6.3 of the FMI 3.0 standard when implementing min/max checking and handling routines.

=== Support for Structured Naming Convention

Importing and exporting implementations should support the structured naming convention for variables specified in the FMI standards to support the interchange of array/matrix and record/struct information.

Starting with FMI 3.0, FMI also supports array variables directly (called native arrays in the following discussion), i.e. without needing to use scalar variables and the structured naming convention.
Hence, for FMI 3.0, implementations should support both native arrays and the structured naming convention.
This support should include support for bridging between these two ways of expressing arrays, especially when supporting older versions of FMI as well as FMI 3.0.
When exporting arrays, preference should be given to native arrays over structured naming convention mappings.

Importing implementations should map complex interfaces expressed via the structured naming convention to suitable internal data structures and formats, like vectors/arrays, records/structs, or busses.

Exporting implementations should map their internal data structures to suitable FMI structured names, mapping vectors to arrays, and records/structs or busses to hierarchical names.

If an implementation supports importing as well as exporting FMUs, the mapping of data structures should allow for efficient round-tripping:
It should be possible to export (part of) a model as an FMU with complex data structures at its interface and have that FMU use structured naming in such a way that the resulting FMU can be imported into the same tool and support the same native interface.

Parameter editors and similar editing UIs and APIs should efficiently support complex data types so that a multi-dimensional array can be efficiently edited, both in terms of speed and user interface.

Exporting complex data structures through the structured naming convention can easily lead to 10,000 or more scalar variables.
Implementations should therefore be prepared to deal with FMUs containing very many scalar variables efficiently.

=== Selection of Exported Parameters/Variables

In order to generate FMUs that are easily handled and also to guard against exposing too many internal details (for both IP protection reasons and reasons of clarity of interfaces), exporting implementations should allow the user to efficiently select which parameters or variables are to be exposed in the FMU as parameters and variables, and which should be kept hidden.

In the case of state variables, this must be done in accordance with the requirements of the standards:
Certain state variables always have to be exposed in Model Exchange FMUs.
